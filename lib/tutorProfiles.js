    bio: 'You are full of care for the world, though not necessarily the other people that inhabit it. Your face rarely reveals the true emotions you have and while on the surface you appear calm you hide a wild heart. As a vegan you value the welfare of the world over your own pleasure although you have built a second house solely for your cat and you worry it isn\'t big enough. You are most at home when working alone but a small amount of praise from a colleague (especially Sam) will raise your spirits and you will allow yourself a small fistpump. You\'ve never called anyone a liar and the only thing you\ve ever imagined is a mouse in a pirate hat.',

    bio: 'You were the best welder to leave Croydon Welding School since Bobby Fingers (b. 1875, d. 1961) with incredible attention to detail and an eye for joints. However, the high-rolling life of welding wasn\t really for you. You love completing a task and, while praise from others is appreciated, you focus mainly on your own satisfaction. You stay fit by trying to catch pigeons and while you have never caught one you know that the journey is more important than the destination. You do your best to help others and empathise and know that worldly posessions do not bring true happiness. You once clear jumped over a horse but have no idea how.',

Your history of wrestling bears in the forest of Canada has honed your body and your senses and given you a great appreciation of life.
